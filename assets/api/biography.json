In my previous position I introduced continuous integration methodologies and managed a Linux CI server running Gitlab and Jenkins instances as well as other connected Node.js applications, including a backend API service supporting a custom developer dashboard. In a different past position I was responsible for adding new features to the Java codebase for a sensor data aggregation system for the US Navy."

Currently I am implementing the event log architecture comprising a Node.js API that validates events and feeds them into an InfluxDB instance. We then use Grafana to build dashboards for reporting and alerting. I'm also building a Dockerized API and database to support softwaredaily.com's end-to-end testing."
